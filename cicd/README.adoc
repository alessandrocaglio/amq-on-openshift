== Helm chart

A Helm chart to deploy AMQ broker with the operator can be found at https://github.com/amq-broker-hub/amq-openshift-helm-chart:

* OLM related CRs: _OperatorGroup_, _Subscription_
* Broker operator CRs: _ActiveMQArtemis_, _ActiveMQArtemisAddress_, _ActiveMQArtemisSecurity_

This generic Helm chart is a good starting point to implement your own version that's probably more specific to your requirements.
